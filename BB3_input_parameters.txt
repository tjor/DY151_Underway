##### BB3 parameters that need to be updated for every cruise
# WARNING: all the values below are inappropriate for this cruise, but they are used to check that the code is working

   wv  = [470 532 700]; # in principle, this could be read from the BB3 files during step1

## scaling factors (this is "S" in D09)
# these are tyically derived from pre (and/or post) cruise calibrations 
   SF = [11.0 7.127 2.983 ]*1e-6;  


## dark counts (this is "D" in DallOlmo et al 2009, D09)
# these are derived from all dark-counts experiments conducted during the cruise
   DC = [50 42 46];         
   DC_err = [1.2 1.2 1.2];  % uncertainties in dark counts

    
## wall effect, this is "b_{b,wall}" in D09
# this can be derived in two ways:
# i) until AMT25, from wall-effect experiment(s) (check logbook)
# ii) from AMT26, from MilliQ measurements taken for aCDOM (i.e., ay) after the BB3 meter and its chamber were cleaned
